# My Learning Lab

A collection of small, focused projects that accompany my Obsidian vault notes
across multiple tech stacks.

This repository exists to:

- Reinforce concepts through hands-on practice
- Keep example code separate from conceptual notes
- Serve as a reference for future projects and frameworks

---

## What this repo is

- A **project dump** for learning experiments
- Each folder represents a **self-contained mini project**
- Projects may be incomplete, iterative, or exploratory by design

This is not a polished portfolio — it’s a learning log in code form.

---

## Things not tracked

> (Note to future me)

- `node_modules/`  
  Not needed. Run `npm install` inside the project folder if required.

- `package-lock.json`  
  This is a notes + learning repo, not a production app.
  Dependency resolution can be regenerated when needed.

## Relationship to my notes

- Concepts, explanations, and pitfalls live in my **Obsidian vault**
- This repo contains **concrete implementations** of those ideas
- Notes will reference code here.
- Code here will generally not link back to notes, since the vault is private
  and for my torment only.
  Exception: some Jupyter notebooks may be self-contained, with notes and code
  living together.
- Some projects may include small README files to briefly summarize
  what concepts are being practiced.

Think of this as the **execution layer** for my learning.
